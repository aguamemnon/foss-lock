Note about Model directory: 
This does not follow the standard namespacing.  
The namespace for the two classes in this directory are  FossLock.Model, instead of FossLock.Web.Model
This is so it merges with the namespace for our model classes in the FossLock.Model project, where our POCO classes live.
