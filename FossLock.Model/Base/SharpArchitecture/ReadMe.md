# SkyBee.Base.SharpArchitecture

Must of these base classes have been duplicated from the SharpArchitecture 
have been duplicated from the Sh#rpArchitecture project.  Very few modifications
have been made here, except for unflagging some of the properties are virtual 
(according to a lot of their inline documentation, absolutely all properties 
were marked as virtual because NHibernate requires everything to be marked as virtual
to enable lazy loading?? .. I guess.)
